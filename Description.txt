We will have a client which will be in contact with an RPC server.
WHENEVER THE CLIENT PRODUCES ANY MESSAGE IT WILL BE SENT TO A RPC QUEUE
THIS RPC QUEUE WILL FORWARD THE MESSAGE TO THE RPC server
THIS SERVER WILL THEN DO A OPERATION AND AFTER THE OPERATION IS COMPLETED,
SEND THE RESULT BACK TO THE REPLY QUEUE
THE CLIENT WILL PRODUCE TO THE RPC QUEUE AND CONSUME THE REPLY QUEUE
THE RPC_SERVER WILL PRODUCE TO A QUEUE SPECIFIED BY THE CLIENT AND CONSUME FROM THE RPC QUEUE
WITH EACH MESSAGE WE SEND FROM THE CLIENT WE CAN SPECIFY THE CORRELATION_ID 
TO TRACK OUR MESSAGES AND ALSO THE REPLY_TO TO SPECIFY WHICH QUEUE THE RPC_SERVER
SHOULD PUBLISH TO.
THE RabbitMQ EXCHANGE WE ARE USING WILL BE OF DEFAULT TYPE AND THE ROUTING KEY 
WILL BE THE QUEUE NAME
